# Legal / compliance notes (AU-focused, high level)

Not legal advice.

## Red flags in the described token
A token that gives a pro‑rata right to access/benefit from real property can be characterised as:
- a security/financial product,
- a managed investment scheme,
- or create land-law complications.

## How to reduce risk (practical)
- Describe token as **platform entitlement / membership**, not investment.
- Do not market “profit”, “yield”, “land appreciation”, or “rent share”.
- Separate:
  - property ownership (HoldCo)
  - platform membership/usage rights (token)
  - operations (OpCo)
- Consider KYC/AML if tokens are tradable.
- Have a solicitor review the structure before any public sale.

## MVP safe posture
- Build everything on testnet.
- No public sale. No promises.
- Token gating can use allowlisted wallets.
- Any physical access to land is governed by a separate real‑world agreement.
